You get 3 cute little tins full of the candies and each had a freshness seal around them. The tin was easy to open, there were no sugar pieces from the coating that fell out, and each tin had 21 pieces in them. I found the size of the coffee drops to be quite adequate, not too small and not too big. I saw where a couple people thought they were huge but they’re about the size of a jelly bean but not as fat. They have a smooth coffee flavor with some sugar added in to make them the perfect little sweet. I found them to be very tasty and enjoyable. One candy at a time is plenty for a treat. They arrived in a cute black box that makes them perfect for gift giving and the tins are the perfect size to put in your purse, pocket, desk drawer, end table or pretty much anywhere else that you want to tuck away some coffee sweetness. We thought these were so good that we’re going to try one of Cavendish & Harvey’s variety packs next.<br /><br />I received this item at a discount in exchange for an honest, unbiased review.

The tin was easy to open, there were no sugar pieces from the coating that fell out, and each tin had 21 pieces in them. I found the size of the coffee drops to be quite adequate, not too small and not too big. I saw where a couple people thought they were huge but they’re about the size of a jelly bean but not as fat. They have a smooth coffee flavor with some sugar added in to make them the perfect little sweet. I found them to be very tasty and enjoyable. One candy at a time is plenty for a treat. They arrived in a cute black box that makes them perfect for gift giving and the tins are the perfect size to put in your purse, pocket, desk drawer, end table or pretty much anywhere else that you want to tuck away some coffee sweetness.

Update this initial code:
```python
# TODO: import the required dependencies
import pandas as pd

# Write code here

# Declare result var: 
type (possible values "string", "number", "dataframe", "plot"). Examples: { "type": "string", "value": f"The highest salary is {highest_salary}." } or { "type": "number", "value": 125 } or { "type": "dataframe", "value": pd.DataFrame({...}) } or { "type": "plot", "value": "temp_chart.png" }

```



### QUERY
 how many positive text are in this dataframe

Variable `dfs: list[pd.DataFrame]` is already declared.

At the end, declare "result" variable as a dictionary of type and value.

If you are asked to plot a chart, use "matplotlib" for charts, save as png.
